# SOM-GCNN
Neural network architecture for learning graphs based on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) structure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to use the model network a series of packages are necessary such as the Pytorch packages, Pytorch Geometric and Minisom.

1. Install Pytorch from https://pytorch.org
2. Install PyTorch Geometric by following: https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric
3. Install Minisom by following the instruction in: https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom

To run the accuracy on PTC_MR dataset:
  '''
  ./run110.sh
  '''
